Many times we need to monitor the people visiting some place like shopping mall. To provide solution for this we are going to implement a project called “Person Counter”. The Basic concept behind this project is to measure and display the number of persons entering/leaving  any room like seminar hall, conference room etc. This works in a two way. That means counter will be incremented if person enters the room and will be decremented if a person leaves the room. By interfacing Arduino with Labview, the no of person entering/leaving a room is counted and displayed.
